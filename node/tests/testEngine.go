//
// The PrototypeByName function can get its job done using only interface types
// that we already know from outside any generated code, so you can write tests
// that have no _compile time_ dependency on the generated code.  This makes it
// easier for IDEs and suchlike to help you write and check the test functions.
//
// Ask for prototypes using the type name alone (no package prefix);
// their representation prototypes can be obtained by appending ".Repr".
