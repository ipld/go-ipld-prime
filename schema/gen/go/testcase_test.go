// This file introduces a testcase struct and a bunch of functions around it.
//  This structure can be used to specify many test scenarios easily, using json as a shorthand for the fixtures.
//  Not everything can be tested this way (in particular, there's some fun details around maps with complex keys, and structs with absent fields), but it covers a lot.

/*
	testcase contains data for directing a sizable number of tests against a NodePrototype
	(or more specifically, a pair of them -- one for the type-level node, one for the representation),
	all of which are applied by calling the testcase.Test method:

		- Creation of values using the type-level builder is tested.
			- This is done using a json input as a convenient shorthand.
			- n.b. this is optional, because it won't work for maps with complex keys.
			- In things that behave as maps: this tests the AssembleEntry path (rather than AssembleKey+AssembleValue; this is the case because this is implemented using unmarshal codepaths).
			- If this is expected to fail, an expected error may be specified (which will also make all other tests after creation inapplicable to this testcase).
		- Creation of values using the repr-level builder is tested.
			- This is (again) done using a json input as a convenient shorthand.
			- At least *one* of this or the json for type-level must be present.  If neither: the testcase spec is broken.
			- As for the type-level test: in things that behave as maps, this tests the AssembleEntry path.
			- If this is expected to fail, an expected error may be specified (which will also make all other tests after creation inapplicable to this testcase).
		- If both forms of creation were exercised: check that the result nodes are deep-equal.
		- A list of "point" observations may be provided, which can probe positions in the data tree for expected values (or just type kind, etc).
			- This tests that direct lookups work.  (It doesn't test iterators; that'll come in another step, later.)
			- Pathing (a la traversal.Get) is used for this this, so it's ready to inspect deep structures.
			- The field for expected value is just `interface{}`; it handles nodes, some primitives, and will also allow asserting an error.
		- The node is *copied*, and deep-equal checked again.
			- The purpose of this is to exercise the AssembleKey+AssembleValue path (as opposed to AssembleEntry (which is already exercised by our creation tests, since they use unmarshal codepaths)).
		- Access of type-level data via iterators is tested in one of two ways:
			- A list of expected key+values expected of the iterator can be provided explicitly;
			- If an explicit list isn't provided, but type-level json is provided, the type-level data will be marshalled and compared to the json fixture.
			- Most things can use the json path -- those that can't (e.g. maps with complex keys; structs with absent values -- neither is marshallable) use the explicit key+value system instead.
		- Access of the representation-level data via interators is tested via marshalling, and asserting it against the json fixture data (if present).
			- There's no explicit key+value list alternative here -- it's not needed; there is no data that is unmarshallable, by design!

	This system should cover a lot of things, but doesn't cover everything.

		- Good coverage for "reset" pathways is reached somewhat indirectly...
			- Tests for recursive types containing nontrivial reset methods exercise both the child type's assembler reset method, and that the parent calls it correctly.
		- Maps with complex keys are tricky to handle, as already noted above.
			- But you should be able to do it, with some care.
		- This whole system depends on json parsers and serializers already working.
			- This is arguably an uncomfortably large and complex dependency for a test system.  However, the json systems are tested by using basicnode; there's no cycle here.
		- "Unhappy paths" in creation are a bit tricky to test.
			- It can be done, but for map-like things, only for the AssembleEntry path.
			- PRs welcome if someone's got a clever idea for a good way to exercise AssembleKey+AssembleValue.  (A variant of unmarshaller implementation?  Would do it; just verbose.)
		- No support yet for checking properties like Length.
			- Future: we could add another type-hinted special case to the testcasePoint.expect for this, i suppose.
