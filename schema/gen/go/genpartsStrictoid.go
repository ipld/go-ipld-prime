	// This method contains a branch to support MaybeUsesPtr because new memory may need to be allocated.
	//  This allocation only happens if the 'w' ptr is nil, which means we're being used on a Maybe;
	//  otherwise, the 'w' ptr should already be set, and we fill that memory location without allocating, as usual.
	//  (Note that the Maybe we're talking about here is for us, not our children: so it applies on unions too.)
