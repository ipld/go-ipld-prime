	// will be returned.

	// If the key does not exist, a nil node and an error will be returned.
	LookupString(key string) (Node, error)

	// Lookup is the equivalent of LookupString, but takes a reified Node
	// as a parameter instead of a plain string.
	// This mechanism is useful if working with typed maps (if the key types
	// have constraints, and you already have a reified `typed.Node` value,
	// using that value can save parsing and validation costs);
	// and may simply be convenient if you already have a Node value in hand.
	//
	// (When writing generic functions over Node, a good rule of thumb is:
	// when handling a map, check for `typed.Node`, and in this case prefer
	// the Lookup(Node) method; otherwise, favor LookupString; typically
	// implementations will have their fastest paths thusly.)
	Lookup(key Node) (Node, error)

	// LookupIndex is the equivalent of LookupString but for indexing into a list.

	//
	// If the Kind of this Node is not ReprKind_List, a nil node and an error
	// will be returned.

	// If idx is out of range, a nil node and an error will be returned.

	// of lookup method on maps: `Get($GeneratedTypeKey) $GeneratedTypeValue`!

	// MapIterator returns an iterator which yields key-value pairs
	// traversing the node.

	// can be expected that itr.Next will be called node.Length times
	// before itr.Done becomes true.

	// ListIterator returns an iterator which yields key-value pairs
	// traversing the node.
	// If the node kind is anything other than a list, the iterator will

	// The iterator will yield every entry in the list; that is, it
	// can be expected that itr.Next will be called node.Length times
	// before itr.Done becomes true.

	// Length returns the length of a list, or the number of entries in a map,
	// or -1 if the node is not of list nor map kind.
	Length() int

	// Undefined nodes are returned when traversing a struct field that is
	// defined by a schema but unset in the data.  (Undefined nodes are not
	// possible otherwise; you'll only see them from `typed.Node`.)
	// The undefined flag is necessary so iterating over structs can
	// unambiguously make the distinction between values that are
	// present-and-null versus values that are absent.

	// NodeBuilder returns a NodeBuilder which can be used to build
	// new nodes of the same implementation type as this one.
	//
	// For map and list nodes, the NodeBuilder's append-oriented methods
	// will work using this node's values as a base.
	// If this is a typed node, the NodeBuilder will carry the same
	// typesystem constraints as this Node.
	//
	// (This feature is used by the traversal package, especially in
	// e.g. traversal.Transform, for doing tree updates while keeping the
	// existing implementation preferences and doing as many operations
	// in copy-on-write fashions as possible.)
	//
	// ---
	//
	// More specifically, the contract of a NodeBuilder returned by this method
	// is that it should be able to "replace" this node with a new one of
	// similar properties.
	// E.g., for a string, the builder must be able to build a new string.
	// For a map, the builder must be able to build a new map.
	// For a *struct* (when using typed nodes), the builder must be able to
	// build new structs of the name type.
	// Note that the promise doesn't extend further: there's no requirement
	// that the builder be able to build maps if this node's kind is "string"
	// (you can see why this lack-of-contract is important when considering
	// typed nodes: if this node has a struct type, then should the builder
	// be able to build other structs of different types?  Of course not;
	// there'd be no way to define which other types to build!).
	// For nulls, this means the builder doesn't have to do much at all!
	//
	// (Some Nodes may return a NodeBuilder that can be used for much more
	// than replacing their own kind: for example, Node implementations from
	// the ipldfree package tend to return a NodeBuilder than can build any
	// other ipldfree.Node (e.g. even the builder obtained from a string node
	// will be able to build maps).  This is not required by the contract;
	// such packages only do so out of internal implementation convenience.)
	//
	// This "able to replace" behavior also has a specific application regarding
	// nodes implementing Advanced Data Layouts: it means that the NodeBuilder
	// returned by this method must produce a new Node using that same ADL.
	// For example, if a Node is a map implemented by some sort of HAMT, its
	// NodeBuilder must also produce a new HAMT.

// REVIEW: immediate-mode AsBytes() method (as opposed to e.g. returning
// an io.Reader instance) might be problematic, esp. if we introduce
// AdvancedLayouts which support large bytes natively.
//
// Probable solution is having both immediate and iterator return methods.
// Returning a reader for bytes when you know you want a slice already
// is going to be high friction without purpose in many common uses.
//
// Unclear what SetByteStream() would look like for advanced layouts.
// One could try to encapsulate the chunking entirely within the advlay
// node impl... but would it be graceful?  Not sure.  Maybe.  Hopefully!
// Yes?  The advlay impl would still tend to use SetBytes for the raw
// data model layer nodes its composing, so overall, it shakes out nicely.
