	// To create any links, first we need a LinkPrototype.
	// This gathers together any parameters that might be needed when making a link.

	// Often, you can probably make this a constant for your whole application.

	// And we need some data to link to!  Here's a quick piece of example data:
	n := fluent.MustBuildMap(basicnode.Prototype.Map, 1, func(na fluent.MapAssembler) {

	})

	// Before we use the LinkService, NOTE:
	//  There's a side-effecting import at the top of the file.  It's for the dag-cbor codec.
	//  The CID LinkSystem defaults use a global registry called the multicodec table;
	//  and the multicodec table is populated in part by the dag-cbor package when it's first imported.
	// You'll need that side-effecting import, too, to copy this example.
	//  It can happen anywhere in your program; once, in any package, is enough.
	//  If you don't have this import, the codec will not be registered in the multicodec registry,
	//  and when you use the LinkSystem we got from the cidlink package, it will return an error of type ErrLinkingSetup.
	// If you initialize a custom LinkSystem, you can control this more directly;
	//  these registry systems are only here as defaults.

	// Now: time to apply the LinkSystem, and do the actual store operation!
	lnk, err := lsys.Store(
		ipld.LinkContext{}, // The zero value is fine.  Configure it it you want cancellability or other features.
		lp,                 // The LinkPrototype says what codec and hashing to use.

	// Remember: the serialized data was also stored to the 'store' variable as a side-effect.
	//  (We set this up back when we customized the LinkSystem.)
